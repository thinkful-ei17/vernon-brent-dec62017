BAM.

What if you wanted to equip a weapon for each character and change how
they are described? For example:

Gandolf the White is a Wizard of the Middle Earth who uses a wizard staff
Bilbo Baggings is a Hobbit of the Shire who uses the Ring
Frodo ... String and Barrow Blade
Aragon .... Anduril
Legolas ... Bow and Arrow
Arwen .... Hadhafang
How would you change the factory function and other methods?
